Classification Exercises Completed by Bethany Thompson - Codeup Darden Cohort

- Classification is a technique for labeling the class of an observation. 
- This is done through the modeling of the patterns in the related data which drive the outcome.
- The primary goal of developing a classification model is to generalize patterns. 
- This is done so that the category/class of new data can be identified with a high degree of certaintly. 
- Classification can be performed on structured or unstructured data. 
- It can be used to predict binary classes (2 classes) or multi-classes (>2 classes).
