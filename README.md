Classification Exercises Completed by Bethany Thompson - Codeup Darden Cohort

- Classification is a technique for labeling the class of an observation. 
- Done through the modeling of the patterns in the related data which drive the outcome.
- The primary goal is to generalize patterns. 
- The category/class of new data can be identified with a high degree of certainty. 
  - Can be performed on structured or unstructured data. 
  - Can be used to predict binary classes (2 classes) or multi-classes (>2 classes).
